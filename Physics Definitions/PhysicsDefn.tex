	\section{Measurements}
	Express errors/uncertainties to 1 s.f. and write the measured value to the same decimal place as its error/uncertainty

			\toprule
			Systematic Error & An error that occurs consistently more or consistently less than the actual reading.\\
			Random Error & An error that occurs as a scattering (or spreading) of readings about the average or mean value of the measurements. \\
			\midrule
			Precision & The \textit{\textbf{reproducibility}} of a measurement. Repeated measurements which are very close to one another are precise measurements. Thus an experiment which has \textit{\textbf{small random errors}} (i.e. small spread of readings) is said to have \textit{\textbf{high precision}}. \\
			Accuracy & The \textbf{\textit{agreement}} between the measured value and the true or accepted value of a quantity. An experiment which has \textbf{\textit{small systematic errors}} is said to have \textbf{\textit{high accuracy}}. The \textbf{\textit{average value}} is close to the true value. \\
			\midrule
			Vector Quantity & A quantity that has a \textbf{\textit{magnitude and direction}}. \\
			Scalar Quantity & A quantity that has a magnitude only. \\

	\section{Kinematics}
	We define a coordinate system with defined reference positive directions and we assume constant acceleration.

			\toprule
			Displacement & $\textbf{s}$ & The distance travelled in a stated direction from a reference point. \\
			Velocity & $\displaystyle \textbf{v} = \frac{d\textbf{s}}{dt}$ & The rate of change of displacement with respect to time.\\
			\rule{0pt}{20pt}Speed & $\displaystyle v=\left|\textbf{v}\right| = \left|\frac{d\textbf{s}}{dt}\right|$ & The rate of change of distance travelled with respect to time. \\
			\rule{0pt}{20pt}Acceleration &  $\displaystyle \textbf{a} = \frac{d\textbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\textbf{s}}{dt^2}$ & The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. \\

					1\textsuperscript{st} Law & A body will continue in its \textit{\textbf{state of rest}}, or \textbf{\textit{move}} at \textbf{\textit{constant speed in a stright line}} unless an \textbf{\textit{external resultant force}} acts on it.\\
					$\rightarrow$ Inertia & The resistance to change in the state of motion of an object \\
					$\rightarrow$ Mass & A property of that determines the objects inertia. \\
					\midrule
					2\textsuperscript{nd} Law & The \textbf{\textit{rate of change of linear momentum}} of a body is \textbf{\textit{directly proportional}} to the resultant force acting on it, and its direction is in the \textbf{\textit{same direction}} as this resultant force. \par The \textbf{\textit{force acting on an object}} is defined as the \textbf{\textit{rate of change of linear momentum}} of an object. $$F \propto \frac{dp}{dt}, ~F=ma \textrm{ (if constant mass)}$$ \\
					\midrule
					3\textsuperscript{rd} Law & If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an \textbf{\textit{equal and opposite}} force on body A. \par \textit{Note:} Action-Reaction Pairs act on different bodies and are of the same nature.\\
					\midrule
					Weight & The gravitational force acting on the object. \\
					Weightlessness & There is no contact force acting on the object. \textit{A body experiences apparent weightlessness when the resultant force acting on it is its weight, or it is undergoing freefall.} \\
